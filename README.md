StreetEasy is New York City's leading real estate marketplace.

I worked with a dataset containing 5000 rental listings in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, active on StreetEasy in June 2016.

I've found the correlation between several features and the rent, built and evaluated a multiple linear regression model, and used the model to present findings.
